# This is a practice page for using sprites in forms

## Overview

This repo started in my early days of the Code Fellows bootcamp program. It's a work in progress in a practice sort of way.

Icons are my favorite to use but it's helpful to understand what a sprite is and how they move depending on the orientation you set up.

## What's a sprite?

Short version: think of it as a sheet of images or shapes that moves behind your webpage and depending where you "cut holes out" and move the sheet of sprites around you'll be able to see the image you want.

More technical: Sprites are used in web development to load multiple image resources while only needing a single HTTP request to retrieve a single resource. Take a look at this article for an overview [CSS Sprites: What They Are, Why They're Cool, and How To Use Them](https://css-tricks.com/css-sprites/).
